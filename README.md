# Monte_carlo_simulations
Monte Carlo Simulation is a powerful technique to simulate and predict the probabilistic outcomes by feeding random samples

Monty Hall Problem
It is a famous problem named after the famous Monty Hall show. In show the praticipants are asked to choose one of the three gates in which only one has the prize.
Then one gate is revealed by the host that don't have prize and then participants are given an option if they want to change there choise.


BirthDay Paradox
Another interesting problem where how many numbers of people should be present in the party that probability of having atleast one pair of same birthday becomes P.

Pipe defect detection problem
Say if there are 3 instruments that can detect the defect in the pipe with accuracy a,b and c, then calculate the probability that the defect in the pipe was detected.
